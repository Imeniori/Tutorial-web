<p class="textt">Kingdom Hearts (キングダム ハーツ, Kingudamu Hātsu) is the first game in the Kingdom Hearts video game series. 
It was developed and published by Square in 2002. Revolving around a fourteen-year-old boy named Sora, the game details his adventures after his homeworld is destroyed by sinister creatures known as the Heartless, and his attempts to restore his world and reunite with his friends. In the process, he meets many characters from classic Disney films and a handful from the Final Fantasy video game series. The main theme song for the game is "Simple and Clean", performed by Hikaru Utada.
Chronologically, Kingdom Hearts follows Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and takes place before Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, as well as partially overlapping with Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A Fragmentary Passage-.
